If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

a bit more energetic than average on the scale from 0 to 1.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

we can calculate different averages, for example, like this:

SELECT AVG(energy) AS average FROM songs UNION SELECT AVG(danceability) AS average FROM songs UNION  SELECT AVG(loudness) AS average FROM songs;

Maybe assigning some weight to each variable afterwards.
